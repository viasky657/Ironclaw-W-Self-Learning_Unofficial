//! End-to-end lifecycle test for the skill `setup_marker` exclusion.
//!
//! Drives a real agent turn through the skill-selection pipeline to
//! verify that a one-time setup skill:
//!
//! 1. **Activates** on the first matching message (marker absent) —
//!    its distinctive prompt content appears in the LLM system prompt
//! 2. **Is excluded** on a second matching message after the marker
//!    file has been written to the workspace — its prompt content is
//!    absent from the LLM system prompt
//!
//! This is the integration-tier cover for the unit tests in
//! `crates/ironclaw_skills/src/selector.rs::tests::test_setup_marker_*`
//! and the v2 equivalent in
//! `crates/ironclaw_engine/src/executor/orchestrator.rs::handle_list_skills`.
//!
//! ## Why assert on the LLM system prompt content, not on `active_skill_names()`
//!
//! The v1 and v2 engine paths emit `StatusUpdate::SkillActivated`
//! events at different layers — v1 from `src/agent/agent_loop.rs`,
//! v2 from the Python orchestrator via `EventKind::SkillActivated`.
//! Testing through the status-event surface would couple the test to
//! whichever path the rig's default configuration selects.
//!
//! The **actual effect** of skill selection is that the skill's
//! prompt content gets injected into the LLM system prompt. That is
//! the contract the selector exists to enforce, and it's the same
//! contract on both paths. We assert on the captured LLM request
//! messages (via `rig.captured_llm_requests()`), which makes the test
//! agnostic to the internal plumbing: if the skill is selected, its
//! distinctive marker string appears in the system prompt; if it's
//! excluded, the string is absent.

This is a lifecycle test skill. In a real setup skill this body would
contain the onboarding steps. Here it's intentionally minimal — we
just need the manifest to parse and load, and the marker string
above to be injectable into the LLM system prompt when the skill
is selected.
