//! Inline gate-await bridge controller.
//!
//! Implements [`ironclaw_engine::GateController`] for the bridge layer.
//! When the engine hits an `Approval` gate inside a live execution
//! (Tier 0 batch or Tier 1 CodeAct VM), it calls
//! [`BridgeGateController::pause`] which:
//!
//! 1. Builds and persists a [`PendingGate`] (existing UI machinery
//!    discovers the prompt through the same store / SSE / channel
//!    flow as before).
//! 2. Registers a [`oneshot::Sender`] keyed by `request_id` in a
//!    process-wide registry shared with the resolve endpoint.
//! 3. Awaits the receiver. The future stays parked here, holding the
//!    engine's call stack open, until the user resolves the gate.
//!
//! On the resolve side, [`GateResolutions::try_deliver`] looks up the
//! sender by `request_id` and hands the [`GateResolution`] back into
//! the suspended engine. The engine continues from the exact
//! suspension point — no re-entry, no replay, no double-execution of
//! prior side effects in the same step.
//!
//! ## Single instance, per-thread context
//!
//! The controller is a single shared instance (held by `EngineState`,
//! attached to `ThreadManager` at boot). Per-execution data
//! (conversation id, channel metadata, original message, scope thread
//! id) lives in a `HashMap` keyed by `(user_id, thread_id)`. The
//! bridge populates an entry before invoking
//! `ConversationManager::handle_user_message`; if a gate fires during
//! that execution, the controller looks up the entry to construct the
//! `PendingGate`. Stale entries (from a turn that completed without
//! gating) are removed by the bridge after the call.
