# Bridge Module

Adapter layer between the engine v2 (`ironclaw_engine`) and the host
crate's execution, auth, LLM, and persistence surfaces. Channels,
handlers, and tool runtimes must not re-implement auth or identity
resolution — they call through these adapters.

## Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `auth_manager.rs` | Centralized authentication state machine. Pre-flight credential checks, setup instruction lookup, auth-flow extension-name resolution. **Single source of truth for turning a credential/action into an `ExtensionName`.** |
| `router.rs` | `handle_with_engine()` — maps engine outcomes to channel responses. Owns auth-gate display + submit target resolution. |
| `effect_adapter.rs` | Implements `EffectExecutor` for the engine. Wraps the host `ToolRegistry` with safety + rate limits. |
| `llm_adapter.rs` | Implements `LlmBackend` for the engine. |
| `store_adapter.rs` | Implements `Store` for the engine (threads, steps, events, memory docs). |
| `cost_guard_gate.rs` | Engine gate that checks cost budget before LLM calls. |
| `skill_migration.rs` | One-shot migration of legacy skill metadata into the engine's capability registry. |
| `workspace_reader.rs` | Read-side adapter between the engine memory store and the workspace. |

## Engine-v2 enablement contract

For engine v2, installed-but-unauthed provider tools are direct-callable.
The model calls them like any ready action; the engine's auth preflight
raises an `Authentication` gate at execute time, the inline-await machinery
parks the VM, and the OAuth callback delivers the resolved credential to
retry the action. `tool_activate` was removed in favor of this contract;
its install + auto-activation behavior is covered by:

- `tool_install` (callable; agent-callable) — installs an extension and
  registers its tools with the engine registry. After install, the new
  tools appear on the next top-level turn (CodeAct does not hot-refresh
  callable tools mid-step). User consent is mediated by the tool's
  `ApprovalRequirement::UnlessAutoApproved` and the seeded `AskEachTime`
  permission rather than by hiding the tool from the agent surface.
- `tool_auth` (callable; v1-only) — manual auth flow surface for non-OAuth
  credential types.
- The auth-preflight + inline-await pipeline (see #3133 / PR #3157) for
  the OAuth gate path.

Integrations that need user setup (`NeedsSetup`, `Inactive`,
`AvailableNotInstalled`) surface in the prompt under `Activatable
Integrations`. The model installs them by calling `tool_install` directly;
the engine's auth preflight handles any credential prompt at execute time.
(Restored in issue #3533 / PR #3559 — `tool_install` was previously
hidden from the model surface, which left "connect my telegram"
narrating manual UI steps instead of running the actual install.)

## Auth-flow extension resolution: one place, no re-derivation

The single authority that maps an auth gate or tool-call context to the installed extension identity is the free function:

**`bridge::auth_manager::resolve_auth_flow_extension_name(action_name, params, credential_fallback, user_id, tool_registry, extension_manager) -> ExtensionName`**

Its precedence order:

1. **User-influenced** — explicit `name` param on enablement/auth tool invocations like `tool_install` / `tool_auth`. This comes from the model or caller arguments, so it's validated via `ExtensionName::new`; invalid values fall through.
2. The action's provider extension, via `ToolRegistry::provider_extension_for_tool`.
3. Canonicalized `action_name` if the extension manager has an installed extension by that name.
4. The caller-supplied `credential_fallback` — last-resort, used only when no extension owns the action.

Every surface that needs an extension name for auth flow MUST call this free function (or delegate through a thin wrapper). The approved wrappers are:

- `AuthManager::resolve_extension_name_for_auth_flow(...) -> ExtensionName` — delegates with `self.tools` and `self.extension_manager`. Used by `bridge::router`.
- `bridge::router::resolve_auth_gate_extension_name(pending) -> Option<ExtensionName>` — used for `GateRequired` SSE and `send_pending_gate_status`.
- `channels::web::features::chat::pending_gate_extension_name(state, ...) -> Option<ExtensionName>` — used for `HistoryResponse.pending_gate` and rehydration. Calls the free function directly so the bare-test-harness path (no `AuthManager` built yet) still runs every branch, not a drift-prone subset.

Wrappers **delegate**; they must not duplicate the precedence rules, reconstruct names from credential prefixes, or fall back to `format!()`-built strings.

**Why it's centralized:** four identity-confusion bugs (#2561, #2473, #2512, #2574) were the same pattern — two layers independently mapping credential→extension, each reaching a different answer when either one drifted. Newtypes (`CredentialName`, `ExtensionName`) prevent the *type* mix-up; this invariant prevents the *value* mix-up. PR #2617 (Copilot review on `server.rs:1420`) caught a near-fifth: the `pending_gate_extension_name` wrapper's no-auth-manager fallback had grown a three-branch copy of the resolver's precedence that quietly skipped branch 3 (canonicalize + installed-extension check). Extracting the free function collapsed the duplicate and restored the invariant.

If you think you need a new derivation path, stop and consolidate into the shared resolver instead. See `.claude/rules/types.md` ("Typed Internals") and `src/channels/web/CLAUDE.md` ("Identity types at the web boundary") for the broader rule.
