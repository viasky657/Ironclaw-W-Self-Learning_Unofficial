//! Regression tests for cross-tenant SSE/WS status event isolation.
//!
//! Reproduces the report that users in a multi-tenant deployment could
//! see another user's status events (Thinking / ToolStarted / ToolResult /
//! ...). The leak vector was the unscoped global broadcast fallback in
//! `GatewayChannel::send_status` — see `mod.rs::dispatch_status_event`.
//!
//! These tests assert two invariants:
//!
//! 1. **Multi-tenant**: a status event without `metadata.user_id` is
//!    DROPPED — no SSE subscriber receives it. Producers that lose
//!    `user_id` along the way silently fail-closed; the warning surfaces
//!    in logs so the producer can be fixed without exposing tenant data.
//! 2. **Single-tenant**: the same dropped-in-multi-tenant case
//!    falls through to a global broadcast — there is one tenant, one
//!    subscriber population, and the unscoped fan-out is by design.
//!
//! Plus the cross-cutting case: if `metadata.user_id` IS present, the
//! event is delivered ONLY to that user's stream, regardless of mode.
