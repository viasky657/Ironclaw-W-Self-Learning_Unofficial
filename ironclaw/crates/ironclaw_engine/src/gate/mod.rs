//! Unified execution gate abstraction.
//!
//! All pre-execution checks (approval, authentication, rate limiting, hooks,
//! relay channel enforcement) are expressed as composable [`ExecutionGate`]
//! implementations evaluated through a [`GatePipeline`].
//!
//! Design invariants:
//! - [`GateDecision`] has no `None` variant — fail-closed by construction.
//! - [`ResumeKind`] is a closed enum — forces all pause paths through
//!   the same storage, resolution, and SSE machinery.
//! - [`GateContext`] borrows everything — zero cloning in the hot path.
