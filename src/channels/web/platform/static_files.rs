//! Static file serving, CSP assembly, and the frontend HTML bundle.
//!
//! This module owns everything the browser pulls from unauthenticated or
//! project-scoped routes: the CSP directive set (single source of truth for
//! both the global response header and the per-response nonce variant), the
//! embedded asset handlers (`/`, `/style.css`, `/app.js`, `/theme.css`,
//! `/favicon.ico`, `/i18n/*`, `/admin*`), the `build_frontend_html` path
//! that splices `.system/gateway/` customizations into the embedded SPA,
//! and the authenticated `/projects/{id}/...` file-serving routes.
//!
//! No feature handlers should depend on the private pieces here — only on
//! the `pub(crate)` surface registered by `start_server()`.

//
// A single source of truth for the gateway's CSP. The static value below is
// used by the global response-header layer for every endpoint.
//
// The gateway serves two flavors of CSP on the same set of directives:
//
// * The static header applied by `SetResponseHeaderLayer` to *every*
//   response (see [`BASE_CSP_HEADER`]). No inline scripts are authorized.
// * A per-response variant produced by [`build_csp`] with a `'nonce-…'`
//   source added to `script-src`, used only by `index_handler` when it
//   serves customized HTML containing inline `<script>` blocks.
//
// Both variants MUST carry the same directive set except for `script-src`
// — if one grows a new `connect-src` origin, the other silently stays on
// the old policy, and customized pages end up under a stricter CSP than
// plain pages (or vice versa). Previous versions of this file duplicated
// the full directive string in two places, so adding a CDN to one was a
// latent regression waiting to happen. Keep every directive as a named
// constant and assemble both flavors via [`build_csp`] so there is a
// single source of truth.

/// `state.workspace` instead would expose one global workspace's
/// customizations to every user, and the process-wide
/// `frontend_html_cache` would pin the leak across requests. We refuse the
/// path entirely and serve the embedded default to all users; per-user
/// customization can ride a future JS-side fetch against
/// `/api/frontend/layout`, which is authenticated and routes through
/// `resolve_workspace(&state, &user)` so it returns the right workspace.
/// See `crates/ironclaw_gateway/static/js/core/widgets.js` — the
/// layout-config IIFE already reads `window.__IRONCLAW_LAYOUT__`, which
/// a future change can populate from a `fetch('/api/frontend/layout')`
/// after auth.
///
/// **Cache key TOCTOU window (known and accepted).** The fast-path cache
/// key is computed by [`compute_frontend_cache_key`] in a single
/// `Workspace::list` call, but the slow-path data read
/// (`read_layout_config` + `load_resolved_widgets`) happens *after* that
/// key is observed, in separate workspace operations. A workspace write
/// landing between the two — operator edits `layout.json` while a
/// request is mid-rebuild — can therefore produce a cache entry whose
/// HTML was assembled from a layout *newer* than the key it's stored
/// under. The next request after the writes settle will recompute the
/// key, see a different fingerprint, and replace the cache entry, so
/// the staleness window is always self-correcting and bounded by one
/// rebuild round-trip.
///
/// This is intentional. Making the read+key+store sequence atomic would
/// require a workspace-level read lock that the rest of the gateway
/// doesn't take, and would punish the (much hotter) cache hit path with
/// extra coordination. The acceptability rests on three observations:
/// (a) the staleness window is bounded by a single `list()` call's
/// worth of wall time, (b) the cache is per-process so the staleness
/// can never outlive `Drop` of `GatewayState`, and (c) layout writes
/// are rare and operator-initiated — there is no realistic workload
/// that fires a write at the cadence required to keep the entry
/// permanently stale. If a future workload changes that calculus, the
